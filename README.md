Here is a resource for [markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

We are interested in projects about image classification.

- Here is a simple [introduction](https://towardsdatascience.com/logistic-regression-detailed-overview-46c4da4303bc) to logistic regression.
- Christopher Bishop's [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf) provides useful information, specifically referencing logistic regression on page 217.
- [NEAT](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf) is a genetic algorithm for unsupervised learning. It is not particularly useful for image processing, but I find it intriguing.
